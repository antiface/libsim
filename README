libsim - A Simulation Library for Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
libsim is a simulation library I wrote to help me when working on projects that
require me to do digital signal processing on small embedded devices. It is hard
to debug an algorithm on the device itself because programming the device takes 
a long time and testing using an oscilliscope can be tricky. This help me play 
around with the algorithm before writing it in C then programming the 
microcontroller.

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
